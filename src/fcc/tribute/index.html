                Kirby Puckett (March 14, 1960 – March 6, 2006) was an American professional baseball player. He played his
                entire 12-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career as a center fielder for the Minnesota Twins (1984–1995).
                Puckett is the Twins' all-time leader in career hits, runs, and total bases. At the time of his retirement,
                his .318 career batting average was the highest by any right-handed American League batter since Joe
                DiMaggio.

            <p class="flow-text">
                Puckett was the fourth baseball player during the 20th century to record 1,000 hits in his first five full
                calendar years in Major League Baseball, and was the second to record 2,000 hits during his first ten full
                calendar years. After being forced to retire in 1996 at age 36 due to loss of vision in one eye from a
                central retinal vein occlusion, Puckett was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2001, his first year of
                eligibility.

                On the morning of March 5, 2006, Puckett suffered a massive hemorrhagic stroke at the home he shared with Olson. He underwent emergency surgery that day to relieve pressure on his brain; however, the surgery failed, and his former teammates and coaches were notified the following morning that the end was near. Many, including 1991 teammates Shane Mack and Kent Hrbek, flew to Phoenix to be at his bedside during his final hours along with his two children Kirby Jr. and Catherine. His fiancée never left his side. Puckett died on March 6, just eight days from his 46th birthday, shortly after being disconnected from life support
